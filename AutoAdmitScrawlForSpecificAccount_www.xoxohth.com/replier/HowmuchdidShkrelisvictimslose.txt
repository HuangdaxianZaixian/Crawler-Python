post title: How much did Shkreli's victims lose?

i don't get it, so the govt says that the money gave back to the investors don't count, because they're not truly returns from their investments, they're just transfers from another investment.If that's the case, why can't S claw back those transfers?  And force the govt to actually pay back the investors for their actual losses from their forfeiture assets?

i get that logic in determining sentencing, but not the forfeiture of assets.  And if youre going to seize assets, fine, but isnt that seizure meant to make whole the losses suffered by investors?  What if Schrelli never paid the invedtoes back?  Would the forfeiture size be double?  The rationale for the forfeiture doesnt make internal sense.

lets say a thief stole  $1,000 from you, and then invested in ETH and turned it into $100,000.  What is required to repay in forfeiture?  1000?  2000? all 100,000?
