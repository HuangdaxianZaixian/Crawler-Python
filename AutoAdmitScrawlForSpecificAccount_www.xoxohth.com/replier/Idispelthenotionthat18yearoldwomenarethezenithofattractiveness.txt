it's not just that.  it's the fucking hormones and pollutants.girls back in the day didn't start their period until 16-17.Girl I was seeing last year was raised by crazy organic vegan hippies so she didn't eat any shit food - had her period when she was 17.

"A larger BMI is associated with a higher level of the hormone leptin, which tells the body you have enough energy reserves to engage in this pursuit called puberty."

obviously, i'm just saying that the deterioration begins earlier than 18 due to shit diet.
