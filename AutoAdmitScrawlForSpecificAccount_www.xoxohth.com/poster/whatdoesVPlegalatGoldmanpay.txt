Dont know about IBD, but at GSAM, VP/assistant GC level, around $300k all in for typical midlevel ex-biglawyer.  They work super hard though, like 8am-9pm not uncommon.Most will be there for a bit and then go in house at a more lifestyle friendly smaller fund.

	That sounds awful.

		A lot of their lawyers come from fried franks investment funds practice.  Biglaw pay with more predictable hours is an upgrade from that perspective.  Its not the kind of place youd stay long term but a launching pad.  I deal with a lot of their lawyers and its a revolving door but for a few senior level types.

	There are Legal VPs at $200M annual revenue dime a dozen software companies that will never be anything more than an acquisition target who make that much.
